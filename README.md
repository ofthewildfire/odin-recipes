# The Odin Project - Recipe Page

## Skills

In this project I used the following skills:

- Links using `<a> </a>`
- <ol> and <ul> tags for lists (ordered and unordered)
- Images and their alt tags, as well as defining height/width to reduce flashing when a page loads
- Pathing, by having the `recipes` in a different folder I had to use the correct pathing to have everything connected properly.
